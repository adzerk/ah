.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBah\-client\fR [\fB\-hcu\fR] [\fB\-s\fR \fISHA\fR] [\fITARGET\fR \.\.\.]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBah\-client\fR tool is used to deploy \fBah\fR services to instances on AWS, either manually by calling \fBah\-client\fR on an instance in an \fBah\fR environment autoscaling group (ASG), or automatically by the ASG\'s launch configuration user\-data script (generated by \fBah\fR) when a new instance is launched\.
.
.P
The \fITARGET\fR arguments correspond to \fBmake\fR(1) targets defined in the \fBah\fR application\'s Makefile\. These goals will be built after \fBah\-client\fR has downloaded the application source, target directory contents, and updated the application\'s environment variables\.
