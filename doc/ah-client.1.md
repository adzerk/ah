ah-client(1) -- simple, service oriented management of AWS resources
====================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`ah-client` [`-hc`] [<TARGET> ...]

## DESCRIPTION

The **ah-client** tool is used to deploy **ah** services to instances on AWS,
either manually by calling `ah-client` on an instance in an **ah** environment
autoscaling group (ASG), or automatically by the ASG's launch configuration
user-data script (generated by **ah**) when a new instance is launched.

The <TARGET> arguments correspond to `make(1)` targets defined in the **ah**
application's Makefile. These goals will be built after `ah-client` has
downloaded the application source, target directory contents, and updated the
application's environment variables.

## OPTIONS

  * `-h`:
    Print help info and exit.

  * `-c`:
    Print **ah** and application environment variables and exit. The output
    format is one <NAME>=<value> pair per line, suitable for use with `eval`
    or `source` in a `bash(1)` shell.
